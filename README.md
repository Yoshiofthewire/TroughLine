# TroughLine

A NYT Connections clone built with Electron and React. Group 16 words into 4 categories of 4 — watch out for red herrings!

## Features

- **Daily Puzzle** — a new puzzle every day, same for all players
- **Random Mode** — infinite random puzzles from the pool
- **Stats Tracking** — games played, win %, streaks, mistake distribution
- **Share Results** — copy an emoji grid to your clipboard
- **Responsive** — works on both desktop and mobile-sized windows

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the Vite dev server and launches Electron. Hot-reload is enabled for the renderer.

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Compiles the React renderer (via Vite) and the Electron main process (via TypeScript).

### Package

```bash
npm run package
```

Produces a distributable Electron binary via electron-builder.

## How to Play

1. Look at the 16 words on the board
2. Select 4 words you think belong to the same category
3. Press **Submit** to check your guess
4. Correct guesses reveal the category as a colored row
5. You get 4 mistakes — after that, the game is over
6. Find all 4 groups to win!

**Difficulty colors:** 🟨 Yellow (easiest) → 🟩 Green → 🟦 Blue → 🟪 Purple (hardest)
